# kf2-mod-manager
A python GUI using Tkinter to download workshop files off steam for Killing Floor 2 Epic Players.

Problem:
Since KF2 players on EGS (EPIC GAME STORE) can not download workshop files as they load into custom servers like Steam players can. 
There needs to be a way for KF2 players can download them before hand joining the server. 

Solution:
This GUI will allow EGS players to download mods as if they were using steam by entering Workshop ID or URL (WIP)
